chapter: Length sensing and Control; outline
-------------------------------------------

-Introduction
(connection to seismic isolation, residual motion of masses,
need to sense and control masses position to be at operating point.)


-Length sensing
---Pound-Drever-Hall sensing
  (The 'workhorse' in length sensing of high precision optical
  cavities. Connection to cavity chapter)
---Heterodyne, Homodyne- and DC readout
---Length sensing of a Michelson interferometer and more general readout
  concepts
---Some more length sensing techniques (2f, 3f, relevant for lock
  acquisition)
---Coupling and decoupling of degrees of freedom / Length sensing of a
  dual recycled Fabry-Perot Michelson (choice of modulation
  frequencies etc)
---Photodetector electronics (if place allows, at least some basics as
  dynamic range and noise, connection to PDs in EOM/PD chapter)



-Closing the loop: Lenght control
---Actuators and dynamic range (including hierarchical control.
  Will actuators be introduced in suspension chapter?)
---Control bandwidth and noise coupling
---Individual length control loops and their interplay
  (IMC/laser freq. chain/CARM,DARM,MICH,PRCL,SRCL)
---Noise reduction by subtraction techniques



-The lock acquisition process
---Lock acquisition (general problem and consideration of approaches)
---Input modecleaners (as more simple example)
---Main Interferometers / DRFPMI
---Transition to low-noise readout



-The Gravitational-wave readout channel
---Filtering of the Output beam: the output mode cleaner (connection to
  cavities and mirrors/TCS chapters)
---Length sensing and control of the output mode cleaner
---Gravitational-wave channel readout
