Peter Fritschel's chapter:

Systems design & trade-offs:

- System design of primary interferometer parameters
  - laser power, cavity finesse, beam size, etc

- System design for secondary interferometer parameters
  - optical loss budget
  - recycling cavity geometry
  - actuation requirements
  - lock acquisition features

- Role of simulations in systems design
  - static interferometer simulations
  - length & alignment sensing/control simulations

- Handling high power effects with systems design

- Managing technical noise sources

- System trade-offs in seismic isolation

- Global controls & filtering
