chapter: Alignment Sensing and Control; outline 
------------------------------------------- 

-Introduction and Requirements
 (connection to seismic isolation, residual angular motion of masses, 
 need to sense and control masses angles to be at operating point.) 


-Angle sensing 
-- Introduction about sensors for angles
--- Optical levers (This could go in the suspension chapter)
--- DC Quadrants 
--- RF Wave front-sensors -- refer here to PDH technique explained in LSC chapter
-- Angle sensing of a single cavity (parallel with LSC chapter - new piece: Gouy phase separation between sensors)
-- Angle sensing of a Michelson interferometer (and/or the IMC?)
-- Angle sensing of a dual recycled Michelson interferometer with Fabry-Perot cavities
---Coupling and decoupling of degrees of freedom (sensing matrix)
---Sensor noise (refer to LSC chapter)


-Closing the loop: Angle control 
--Actuators and dynamic range 
--Control bandwidth and noise coupling 
--The role of radiation pressure
--- Sidles-Sigg instabilities for a single cavity
--- HARD/SOFT modes for the full IFO


-ASC in real life: commissioning of the angle sensing and control system
( I think it can be interesting to have a section which practically describes the "unspoken" challenges typical of essentially all the IFO in the world)
-- Overview of the challenges 
-- Length/Angle coupling, offsets
-- Opto-mechanical response changing as function of input power
-- ASC vs TCS (link with TCS section)
-- The alignment of the OMC (refer to DC readout section in the LSC chapter, papers from GEO and eLIGO)
-- A particularly challenging case: enhanced LIGO (mix of all previous problems, refer to eLIGO ASC paper)
