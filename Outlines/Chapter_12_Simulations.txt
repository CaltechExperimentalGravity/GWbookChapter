Dear Peter,

Apologies for this very late reply. I have attached a suggested table of contents
for the chapter. I have prepared this after several iterations with my student 
Daniel Brown. Daniel has worked with me on various aspects of simulations for the last 
5 years and I’d like to propose him as a co-author for this chapter. There is 
very little existing literature on the motivation and progress of optical 
simulations in the GW community, and we believe that up to half of the chapter 
is required to cover some basics.

The second half would then be more text-book like in giving explicit examples
how to derive the math (equations for the optical field and coupling) suitable
for certain numerical implementations. We plan to give only basic cavity examples
for time domain and FFT code and plan to provide more realistic examples
from the Advanced LIGO design and commissioning based on modal models. This
selection is partly because I am more familiar with this work, but also because
the modal, frequency domain models (Optickle, Finesse, MIST, etc) saw the
greatest push during the Advanced LIGO design phase.

Please have a look at the draft table-of-contents below and let me know
what you think. Thanks a lot!

Cheers,
Andreas

Introduction (1 pages)
- What are interferometer simulations
- Why do we need them (for Advanced detectors)
- What will we describe in this chapter

Motivation (2 pages)
- Laser interferometers are built from classical and
  mostly passive optics which operate in a stable,
  static state which can be well described with
  classical linear optics.
- However, interferometer forms one complex system
  of many simple components. The *complexity* is the
  main challenge.
- Modelling during design phase of a new type
  of instrument allows virtual experimentation
  in advance, this creates confidence in design,
  highlight mistakes

- Principle of modelling:
  a) using realistic model to make experiments 'in silico'
     for validating design, predicting results
  b) modelling a simple/reduced system to understand a
     specific behaviour more fundamentally
  c) playing with the system, for teaching/learning
     outreach
 - High accuracy models of large optical structures not
  feasible due to the nature of the problem (Maxwell,
  solvers, FDTD, ...)
  Physics approximation required for numerical tools
  (memory requirement, run-time)
- GW requires spectacular phase accuracy, many
  commercial simulation packages not good enough
- What did we need to solve for Advanced detectors, signal 
  recycling control, thermal deformation, quantum noise, 
  radiation pressure (examples come later)
- GW community, early development -> AIC - STAIC 1998-2003
  -> now

Types of simulation tools (1 pages)
- Time domain vs Frequency domain
- Modal model versus FFT codes

Time domain simulation of a cavity (3 pages)
- Derive the time domain equations for a field in a
  cavity
- Show how Laplace transform converts this as digital
  filter (i.e. discretised form of equation)
- Show simple example code, result for ringing cavity
- Most versatile, can include non-linear physics, various
  representations of the physics
- can be slow and difficult to interpret
- used for 'lock acquisition'
- Links to E2E and Siesta

Frequency domain simulations (1 pages)
- GW laser interferometers during data taking very stable,
  can be interpreted mostly as stable state with small
  distortions -> Frequency response, faster simultions
- Two methods to find/describe steady state:
  a) describe local couplings and iterate until globally
  stable -> typical FFT code
  b) generate global system description from local couplings
  and find solution -> typical modal model

Paraxial models (2 pages)
- diffraction theory to paraxial wave equation
- approximation that matched GW laser interferometers well
- limitations

FFT propagation (2 pages)
- propagation kernel, interaction with surface, iteration
  to stable state
- show cavity example
- link to SIS, OSCAR, WAVEPROP

Modal model (6 pages)
- setting up interferometer matrix, sparse matrix solver
- beam shapes with model expansion, coupling coefficients
- radiation pressure, quantum noise computation
- cavity example
- Advanced LIGO design/commissioning examples
  - Thermal deformation
  - radiation pressure, quantum noise
- link to MIST, Optickle, Finesse

Other simulations and outlook (1-2 pages)
- Ray tracing, ...
- Current work on simulations, needs for future
  detectors
